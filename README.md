## Basic Version (corresponds to published chapter)

- Uses SWRL rules with numeric comparisons (`swrlb:lessThanOrEqual`, etc.) 

- Defines input scores as data properties

- Executable with Protégé + Pellet



## Advanced OWL Version (Optional Extension)

- Models fuzzy categories (e.g., `MediumFairnessDecision`) using `owl:intersectionOf`

- Represents semantic threshold logic within the ontology

- Not used in the chapter directly, but useful for symbolic-fuzzy hybrid reasoning



This structure allows future research to explore OWL-native semantic modeling in addition to rule-based logic.
